# Image & Drawing Editor
Using Cinder, I plan to create an interface where the user can choose a photo 
from their computer, or draw it with the given drawing tools, and edit it.
They can either edit their images manually with a paintbrush, or use the 
program's features, such as grayscale, blur, etc.

I already have the knowledge to implement the simple drawing mechanic since I know
how to handle mouse inputs and coloring a specific location. The idea interests me
because my friends and I love making funny edits to pictures of each other and use 
diagrams to argue with each other.

For this project, I would like to have the user able to import photos onto the board
and draw on it, or start drawing from scratch. After week 2, I plan to have implemented
photoshop tools that the user can use to edit their photos with filters and effects.
Finally, after week 3, the user will be able to use more advanced tools like blurs
which require image processing. 

If I have the time, I would love to add features so that the user can export their edited
photo quickly, but I'm not sure about how this would work with Cinder's interface. Also,
it would be cool to add a button which uses Google or Amazon image processing to identify 
the image.
